echo This is the suite of spm12Batch unix command-line commands.
echo	 
echo The code was written by Robert C. Welsh over the period of 2005-2021
echo and it is in further development.
echo
echo The driving force behind these scripts is to implement a level of error
echo checking on data structures, parameter specification, logging of commands, 
echo ability to process batches of subjects, and to run in the background.
echo 
echo In general people have found their productivity to increase greatly 
echo through the use of these scripts.
echo 
echo "Presently these scripts are maintained by Robert Welsh (U of Utah) and additional"
echo "contributors to the Psychiatry Methods Core (U of Mich) as well as the BIRB functional"
echo "imaging lab (U of Mich)."
echo
echo The listing of commands is in the rough order that one would do for
echo processing of data from k-space data to final smoothed, MNI-based 
echo T2* images.

echo Developed with support from R01NS052514
