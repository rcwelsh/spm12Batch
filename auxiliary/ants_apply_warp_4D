      # This codelet assumes that it's going to be operating
      # in the directory of the object to be warped.
      #
      # antsM = input file
      #         outputfile name is determined by the prepend
      #         option "outputName"
      #
      # antsP = ants_prepend name for output transformation
      #
      # antsS = source directory, where to find the normalization
      #         rules (ants_1Warp.nii.gz and (ants_0GenericAffine.mat)
      #
      # antsT = template file to base sampling on, this should
      #         match was was used in the antsHiRes command
