# To make this work at your site you need to change the 
# definition of "topDIR" below. Point to the parent directory
# of the spm12 and spm12Batch directories. In our local installation
# the directories "spm12" and "spm12Batch" and "spm12_patch"
# live side-by-side under the same parent. If you wish something differnt 
# than that then you will need "bash" knowledge greater than novice.
#
#
#  Things that you need to change to make it work locally (search for these below):
#
#  topDIR
#  LOCALOWNER
#  MATLAB
#  TemplateImageFile      (we have our own)
#  MAILRECPT
#
#
# YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE TO HAVE ANTs and ANIMA installed and in your path
